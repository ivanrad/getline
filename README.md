# getline/getdelim

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivanra/getline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivanra/getline)

Read a delimited record from stream.

Yet another (hopefully portable C) implementation of getline/getdelim.
These are ersatz functions, a drop-in replacement, to be used on those occasions when your C library does not already support them.

For more details, see [Open Group Base Specification for getdelim/getline][opengroup-spec].
